# File Details

## 1.py

This script is used to rename all files in a specified directory from one extension to another. The directory and file extensions are hardcoded in the script.

## 2.py

This script is more advanced and interactive. It prompts the user to input the directory and file extensions. It then renames all files in the specified directory from the old extension to the new one. The script also includes a function to list all files in a directory and handles the case where the directory does not exist.
